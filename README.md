# Explore2p :microscope:

## BETA


To run on your own computer, go into Explore2p.m and change

```
isTesting = true;
```
to 
```
isTesting = false;
```
on line 4. Then load your local Suite2p output file (*proc.mat) in the GUI (instead of automatically loading the one on my machine). 

This GUI is inspired by/adapted from the GUI in [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289413) biorxiv paper.

This Readme is, obviously, also in beta :shipit:
